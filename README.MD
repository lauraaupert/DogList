##INTRODUCTION

This project was completed for the Columbia University Engineering Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp. Our mission was to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem.

#Background
After COVID hit and quarantining began in March 2020, many people and families decided it was the right time to adopt or buy a dog. Working from home made it possible for people to clean up after puppies, take dogs out for regular walks, and keep up with feeding, grooming, and veterinary care. The kids were home from school and desperate for the kind of entertainment and distraction that a new pet provides.

For some new pet owners, however, circumstances changed. For starters, the kids are back in school, and having a pet is no longer a novelty. Some people lost their jobs during the shutdown, and caring for a dog proved too expensive. Those who still have jobs are beginning to return to the office, and they don't like having to pen up Baxter or Buster or Ruger in a kennel 10 hours a day. And then there are those who died during the pandemic. It's up to their families to find new homes for the pets left behind.

#Solution
We've designed a database app that uses the power of Google Maps to let New Yorkers rehome their covidogs without ever having to place them in a shelter. Neighbors who need to rehome a dog can list the dog and upload its photo to the app, where neighbors looking for a covidog can browse photos, search, and contact the current pet owner to make arrangements for pet handover and pickup.

#USER STORY

_AS THE_ owner of a canine companion in need of a new home (or as someone in search of a furry companion [not that kind!]),
_I WANT TO_ list my pet for adoption in my local area (or find a pet to adopt)
_SO I CAN_ give the dog a more suitable home (or provide a loving home and ease my loneliness).

#FEATURES

##Owner Form to Rehome a Dog

![Form for an owner to post a dog](./DogsList/views/assets/post-form.png)

When dog owners surrender their pets, they use this form to give DogsList as much information as possible about the animal. This detailed info about size,  helps dog seekers find the right pet.
